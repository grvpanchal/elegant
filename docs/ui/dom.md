# DOM

> Document Object Model (DOM), a set of APIs for controlling HTML and styling information that makes heavy use of the Document object

The document currently loaded in each one of your browser tabs is represented by a document object model. This is a "tree structure" representation created by the browser that enables the HTML structure to be easily accessed by programming languages â€” for example the browser itself uses it to apply styling and other information to the correct elements as it renders a page, and developers like you can manipulate the DOM with JavaScript after the page has been rendered.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Simple DOM example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <img
        src="dinosaur.png"
        alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth."
      />
