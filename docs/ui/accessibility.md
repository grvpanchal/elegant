# Accessibility

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) page provides an introduction to web accessibility, emphasizing its importance and fundamental principles. Here's a summary of the key points:

## Accessibility in Context

Web accessibility is crucial for creating inclusive digital experiences. The Web is designed to work for all people, regardless of their abilities, hardware, software, or location. However, poorly designed websites can create barriers that exclude people with disabilities.

## What is Web Accessibility

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes various types of disabilities:

- Auditory
- Cognitive
- Neurological
- Physical
- Speech
- Visual

Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, such as mobile device users, older individuals, and those with temporary or situational limitations.

## Importance of Accessibility

Accessibility is vital for:

- Individuals: Providing equal access and opportunities
- Businesses: Improving user experience, enhancing brand, and expanding market reach
- Society: Supporting social inclusion and meeting legal requirements

## Making the Web Accessible

Accessibility depends on several components working together:

- Web technologies
- Browsers and user agents
- Authoring tools
- Websites

The WAI develops technical specifications, guidelines, and resources to support accessibility solutions.

## Evaluating Accessibility

It's crucial to evaluate accessibility throughout the development process. While evaluation tools can help, human evaluation is necessary to determine if a site is truly accessible.

## Examples of Accessibility Features

- Alternative text for images
- Keyboard input functionality
- Transcripts for audio content

The article emphasizes the importance of incorporating accessibility from the beginning of projects and provides resources for further learning and implementation.
