The Structure represents a **file structure** for the **UI System** in a frontend architecture. It organizes UI components into different levels of abstraction, following the **Atomic Design methodology**. Here's a detailed explanation of the structure:

### **Root Folder: `ui/`**
This is the main directory containing all UI-related files and subfolders.

### **Subfolders**
1. **`atoms/`**
   - Contains the smallest, reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs, icons).
   - Example: The `Button` folder includes all files related to the `Button` component:
     - **`Button.component.js`**: The main implementation of the button component.
     - **`Button.stories.js`**: Storybook file to document and test the button visually.
     - **`Button.style.css`**: CSS file for styling the button.
     - **`Button.test.js`**: Unit tests for the button component.
     - **`Button.type.js`**: Type definitions (e.g., PropTypes or TypeScript types) for the button.

2. **`molecules/`**
   - Contains components made by combining multiple atoms. For example, an input field with a label or a search bar.

3. **`organisms/`**
   - Larger, more complex components formed by combining molecules and atoms. Examples include navigation bars or forms.

4. **`skeletons/`**
   - Placeholder components used during loading states to improve user experience.

5. **`templates/`**
   - Defines page layouts by arranging organisms and other components in a structured way.

6. **`theme.css`**
   - A global stylesheet that manages themes, such as colors, fonts, and spacing across the application.

### Purpose of This Structure
- **Modularity:** Each component is self-contained with its logic, styles, tests, and documentation in one place.
- **Scalability:** The clear separation of concerns allows for easy scaling as new features are added.
- **Reusability:** By following Atomic Design principles, components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Maintainability:** Developers can quickly locate and update specific components without affecting unrelated parts of the codebase.

This structure is ideal for large-scale projects requiring consistent design and efficient collaboration among team members.
