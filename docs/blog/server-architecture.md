# Frontend Server Architecture
<img src="/assets/img/diagrams/state-diagram.png" alt="Frontend Server Architecture with SSR"/>

The diagram represents the architecture of a web application, with a focus on modular design and the separation of backend and frontend components. Below is an analysis of its structure:

## **Key Components**

### **Backend Side**
1. **Providers**:
   - **Forms / Links / Image Localization Module**: Handles content-related functionalities like forms, links, and localized images.
   - **Route Provider**: Manages routing within the application.
   - **Auth Provider**: Responsible for authentication and security mechanisms.
   - **Common Provider**: Acts as a shared utility or service layer connecting other providers.

2. **Renderers**:
   - **SSR Module (Server-Side Rendering)**: Generates pages dynamically on the server for improved performance and SEO.
   - **SSG Module (Static Site Generation)**: Pre-generates static pages for faster delivery.

3. **Services**:
   - **API Services**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend via APIs.
   - **Session Management**: Handles user sessions and authentication states.

4. **Proxy Config**:
   - for routing requests, load balancing, or API gateway functionality.

5. **Container**: It acts as a bridge between the data layer (e.g., backend services, APIs) and the presentation layer (React components that render UI). Containers typically do not include presentational markup themselves but instead pass data and event handlers (via props) to child components.

### **Frontend Side**
1. **Headers**:
   - **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Ensures offline capabilities, responsiveness, and app-like features.
   - **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Optimizes content for search engines.
   - **Protocol / Security**: Implements security measures like HTTPS protocols.

2. **App Shell**:
   - A lightweight framework responsible for rendering the core structure of the application and managing dynamic updates.

3. **Index File**:
   - Serves as the entry point for the frontend application, loading the app shell and initializing components.

### **Containers & Pages**
- Containers encapsulate individual components or modules that render specific parts of a page.
- Pages receive events and props from containers to dynamically display content.

This architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and performance optimization by leveraging modern web development practices such as SSR, SSG, PWA, and API-driven services. It is designed to efficiently handle both dynamic user interactions and static content delivery.
