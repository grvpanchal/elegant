# Static Site Generation

Static Site Generation (SSG) is a web development approach that pre-builds HTML pages at build time rather than generating them on-demand for each user request. This method offers several key benefits:

## How SSG Works

1. Content is written in simple formats like Markdown or JSON
2. A static site generator processes the content and templates
3. Pre-rendered HTML pages are created during the build process
4. These static pages are deployed to a web server or CDN

## Benefits of SSG

- **Improved Performance**: Pages load faster as they're pre-built and ready to serve
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduced vulnerability to common web attacks due to lack of server-side processing
- **Cost-Effective**: Lower hosting costs as there's no need for server-side operations
- **Better SEO**: Pre-rendered pages are easier for search engines to index
- **Scalability**: Static pages can be easily cached and distributed via CDNs

## Use Cases

SSG is particularly well-suited for:
- Content-heavy websites
- Blogs and documentation sites
- Marketing websites with infrequently changing content

While SSG offers many advantages, it may not be ideal for sites requiring real-time data or frequent content updates[1][2][3].
